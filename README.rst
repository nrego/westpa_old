WESTPA 1.0 beta
===============


--------
Overview
--------

WESTPA is a package for constructing and running stochastic simulations using the "weighted ensemble" approach 
of Huber and Kim (1996). For further information, please see the following:

Scalable Software Package For Weighted Ensemble Simulation and Analysis," J. Chem. Theory Comput., 11: 800âˆ’809 (2015).

WESTPA is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License, Version 3. See the file ``COPYING`` for more information.


------------
Requirements
------------

WESTPA is written in Python and requires version 2.7. WESTPA further requires
a large number of scientific software libraries for Python and other
languages. The simplest way to meet these requirements is to download the
Anaconda Python distribution from www.continuum.io (free for all users).

WESTPA currently runs on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and
Mac OS X. It is developed and tested on x86_64 machines running Linux.


------------
Installation
------------

After obtaining a copy of the code (see
https://chong.chem.pitt.edu/wewiki/Obtaining_the_WESTPA_code for details), run
``setup.sh`` in the ``westpa`` directory. If the version of Python you will
be using to run the code is not first on your $PATH, then set the environment
variable WEST_PYTHON to the Python interpreter you want to use. For example::

    cd westpa
    export WEST_PYTHON=/opt/anaconda/bin/python2.7
    ./setup.sh


---------------
Getting started
---------------

High-level tutorials of how to use the WESTPA software are available from
https://chong.chem.pitt.edu/wewiki/WESTPA_tutorials. Further, all WESTPA
command-line tools (located in ``westpa/bin``) provide detailed help when
given the -h/--help option.


------------
Getting help
------------

Documentation is available from the WESTPA wiki, located at
https://chong.chem.pitt.edu/wewiki.

A mailing list for WESTPA is available, at which one can ask questions (or see
if a question one has was previously addressed). This is the preferred means
for obtaining help and support. See http://groups.google.com/group/westpa-users
to sign up or search archived messages.
